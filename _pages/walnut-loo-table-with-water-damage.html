				<p style="text-transform: uppercase;">
THIS LOO TABLE WAS SUBJECTED TO A DOWNPOUR OF HOT WATER.  <br><br>
THE RESULTING LOOSE VENEER WAS CAREFULLY LIFTED AND RE GLUED WITH PERIOD APPROPRIATE BONE GLUE, NOT SYNTHETIC MODERN GLUE!  <br><br>
THE WATER MARKED FINISH WAS REMOVED.   VENEER WAS FED WITH AN OIL MIXTURE, ENHANCING THE BEAUTIFULLY FIGURED WALNUT, BEFORE RE FRENCH POLISHING.
